# Run once per AWS account, before either option: the bucket that holds the
# Terraform state of `ecs/` and `ec2/`. Locking needs no table: the S3 backend
# writes a lock file next to the state (`use_lockfile`, Terraform 1.10+).
#
# A local state file on someone's laptop is the easiest way to lose track of a
# deployment, and a second person running `apply` without a lock is the easiest
# way to damage one. This root keeps its own state locally on purpose: it has
# one protected bucket and nothing else depends on its state.
